  "description": "# Outliar\n\n## Starting the game\nThere is only one \"Outliar\" in the game and the rest of the players are \"Ally\".\nThe Allies are informed of the Outliar's identity,\nThe Outliar is unaware of their role and is incorrectly told that one of the Allies is the Outliar.\nEveryone will have an Outliar in their sight,\nso the challenge is to discern whether the Outliar you see is indeed the real one, or if you, yourself, are the actual Outliar.\nThe goal for the Allies is to vote out the Outliar.\nThe goal for the Outliar is to discover their own identity and press the emergency button.\nPlayers are given random voting cards that represent the different players in the game.\n\n## Game Round\nIn each round, players simultaneously choose one of the following actions, and then the actions are carried out from left to right:\n\n* Emergency\n\n  If **ANY** player chooses this action, the Outliar wins.\n  So be careful not to let the Outliar know who they are.\n  **DO NOT** choose this action easily,\n  since if you are an Ally, you will lose the game at once.\n\n* Vote\n  - If only one player chooses this action, they will get to look at another players hand and pick a card to trade.\n  - If two people choose the action, players will pick a voting card.\n     + If all players except one accuse the Outliar, Allies win.\n     + If the players accidentally vote out a Ally; The Outliar wins.\n     + If neither happens, play continues\n\n* Videocam\n\n  Allow you to view another player's entire hand of cards.\n\n* Trade\n\n  Select another player to trade.\n  Pick a card to trade. (Cards that have your color must be chosen first.)\n  Other player will then choose one of their own.\n\n* Vault\n\n  Choose one card to trade with a random card from the Vault. (Must choose card of own color first.)\n\n## Special Cards\n\n* Rainbow card\n\n  This card is wild and neutral, and will count towards anyone.\n\n* Blank card\n\n  This card is Neutral but has no use but as a place holder for another card, or to abstain from showing who the actual target is.\n"
